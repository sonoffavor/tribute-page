            <h2>The Great Controversy Theme</h2>
            <p>The Great Controversy theme was a topic that Douglass enjoyed talking and writing about. He recognized
                that it is “the core concept that brings coherence to all Biblical subjects. It transcends the age-old
                divisions that have fractured the Christian church for centuries.”<sup><a
                        href="https://www.ministrymagazine.org/archive/2000/12/the-great-controversy-theme"
                        target="_blank">1</a></sup> He articulates this theme in <i>God at Risk</i> and <i>The Heartbeat
                    of Adventism</i>.</p>
            <h2>Theological Controvery</h2>
            <p>History testifies to the fact that theological controversies can be brutal. Douglass, however, never
                allowed theological differences to spoil a good friendship. The quote below is from a friend of Douglass
                who did not agree with him.</p>
            <blockquote id="quote">
                <p>The more I knew about Herb, the more certain I was that he was wrong on certain theological issues,
                    yet the more I liked and respected him. . . There are few scholars who can write for all audiences.
                    Even rarer is the person who can have strong convictions, share them firmly, and yet do so in a
                    cordial, even Christ-like way. That was my friend Herb Douglass.</p>
